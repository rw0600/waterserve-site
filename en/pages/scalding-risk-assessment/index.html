								<h1>Scalding Risk Assessment</h1>
								
								<h2><span>Prevention of scalding with thermostatic&nbsp;mixing valves (TMV)</span></h2>
<p><span>High water temperatures create a scalding risk to vulnerable 
people who use care services. Those at risk from scalding/burning 
include children, the elderly, those with reduced mental capacity, 
reduced mobility and anyone with sensory impairment , or who cannot 
react appropriately, or quickly enough, to prevent injury. </span></p>
<p><span>They may be in hospitals, care homes, social services premises 
and special schools (ie. health and social care establishments). The 
risk of scalding/burning should also be assessed in community facilities
 such as hostels, staffed and sheltered housing for the elderly, the 
mentally ill, and those with learning difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span>In recent years the implementation of appropriate temperature 
control arrangements has meant that the frequency of reported fatal and 
major injury accidents to vulnerable people who use care services has 
reduced considerably. For the period April 2001 to March 2006 RIDDOR 
statistics identified 2 fatal incidents and 8 major injuries 
attributable to hot water scalds in health and social care 
premises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span> However, there have been a number of highly successful 
prosecutions following accidents to vulnerable people, including one 
instance where a company was fined £30,000 for failure to fit TMVs to a 
bath. </span></p>
<h2><span>Nature of the problem</span></h2>
<p><span>One of the main reasons given for maintaining hot water 
temperatures (ie above 50oC) in health and social care premises is to 
control legionella bacteria which can be harmful. Those particularly at 
risk include the elderly and those with cancer, diabetes, chronic 
respiratory or kidney disease. Bacteria are usually found in water 
systems, whirlpool bathers and hydrotherapy baths.</span></p>
<p><span>It has been suggested that the need to control legionella 
bacteria and to prevent/control the risk of scalding may be in conflict 
with, and cause unnecessary burden to, health and social care providers.
 For example, some employers, particularly smaller care homes, have 
argued that water temperatures have been increased purely to combat the 
risk of legionella. </span></p>
<p><span>However, an increase in the risk of scalding cannot be justified as a consequence of introducing precautions against legionella.</span></p>
<h2><span>How Waterserve can help you</span></h2>
<p><span>Waterserve surveyors will carry out&nbsp;a risk assessment 
survey to identify potential scalding risks from hot water temperatures 
and to assess the vulnerability of all those who have access to bathing 
and washing facilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Where TMV's are already part of your water delivery system we 
will as part of our risk assessment survey review the documented 
maintenance and inspection records&nbsp;and make appropriate 
recommendations for remedial actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
