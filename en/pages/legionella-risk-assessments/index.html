								<h1>Legionella Risk Assessments</h1>
								
								<p>Our customers appreciate the attention to detail 
our&nbsp;site specific reports give, as opposed to&nbsp; generic reports
 normally associated with data input&nbsp;via PDA electronic devices.<br>
<br>Waterserve Legionella risk assessments are supplied as hard copy 
bound into A4 hard back folders or digitally in the form of an 
interactive CD-ROM using Adobe PDF.</p>
<p>The digital version gives quick and easy access to all sections
of the report and allows&nbsp; for the distribution to
managers and staff for comment, as required under paragraph 17 of L8 where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This includes changes to the work that may
affect their health and safety at work, arrangements for getting
competent help, information on the risks and controls, and the planning
of health and safety training."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<h2>Waterserve principles of Legionella risk assessment</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Waterserve risk assessment process includes detailed inspection 
of the water systems and audit of site management procedures and 
records. </li>
<li>Waterserve recommends precautionary measures to reduce the risk by breaking the causative chain. </li>
<li>Waterserve assesses the risk based on the principle RISK&nbsp; = 
HAZARD x EXPOSURE, where the hazard is the Legionella bacteria and the 
likelihood of the hazard being present is based on the condition of the 
water supply used. Exposure is based on the potential for a system to 
promote the multiplication of Legionella bacteria and produce an aerosol
 in the vicinity of site personnel or is allowed to drift into the wider
 population.</li></ul>
<h2>Get your priorities right</h2>
<p>A comprehensive document is produced which includes detailed scrutiny
 of Legionella management system and site specific equipment and system 
survey data. Which includes condition and technical observations, 
photographs, risk rating and recommendations to reduce the risk.&nbsp; 
Options include Legionella and microbiological 
analysis&nbsp;with/without AutoCad™ schematic drawings.</p>
<h2>What do we have to do to comply</h2>
<p>Having collected the survey data and produced a system risk rating, 
Waterserve will detail recommended precautionary measures to reduce the 
overall risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would&nbsp;include management 
responsibilities, staff training requirements, paperwork record systems 
as well as system maintenance, refurbishment and routine water quality 
monitoring and inspection programmes.<br>
<br>All recommendations are prioritised on the basis of their cost 
effectiveness on the overall risk rating so that subsequent completion 
of that action produces the maximum risk reduction.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Emphasis is placed on providing guidance and practical solutions. 
Because we understand the increasing pressure on budgets, our system of 
action prioritisation will ensure that money spent on high priority 
actions will produce the maximum benefit in terms of risk reduction.</p>
<h2>Up-to-date and current action plan</h2>
<p>The document will become out of date as soon as recommendations are 
carried out and signed off.&nbsp; With the Waterserve system, the 
recommendations are produced in tabular form with the facility to detail
 to whom each action has been assigned and to subsequently sign off each
 action as it is completed providing the all important audit 
trail.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The assessment document therefore becomes an action plan, as required
 by the Health and Safety Executive, and if kept up-to-date remains 
current, saving site management time and resources. </p>
